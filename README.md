## Description

The Library Management System is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate the management of a library's catalog. With two types of users, **employees** and **normal users**, the system allows for distinct access levels and features. **Employees** have the capability to manage the library catalog—adding, editing, or removing books—while **normal users** can register, log in, and view the library catalog, though they lack search and filtering options for simplicity.

### Background

This system was developed to streamline category management in library environments, giving employees an intuitive interface to keep the category updated and allowing normal users easy access to the category for book browsing.
